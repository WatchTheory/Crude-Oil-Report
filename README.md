While doing this project I learned on just how much crude Oil the U.S produced and how much other countries are buying from the U.S. I learned about just how to oil the Gulf Coast Field Production produces every year. A majority of the oil produced in the U.S comes from the Gulf Coast Field Production (PADD 3). 
It includes serverl states including Alabama, Arkansas , Louisiana , Mississippi, New Mexico and Texas. With most of that coming from Texas, there is also a federal offshore Oil in the Gulf of Mexico that is included in the Gulf Coast Field Production.

## Notes On the Project
While working on the dataset, I notice that from 1957 the amount of oil being exported in the U.S decrease all the way to 187 barrels for the year. After 1972 the amount of barrels 
increased rapid 697 barrels in 1973 to 104,935 barrels in 1980. This trend was due to the 1972 oil embargo that happen to the Western countries.

Since 2019 the US has been a major exporter in Crude Oil
